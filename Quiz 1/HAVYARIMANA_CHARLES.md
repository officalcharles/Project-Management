Here are 3 of my favorite exercises and why:

| Exercise             | Reasoning  | Image |
|----------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Barbell Shoulder Press** | Unlike other shoulder exercises, with the barbell, you can easily overload this movement. Itâ€™s also just really fun to throw some weight over your head. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b04ec2e1-3fc6-4b38-9acb-63661078ba3b)

| **Goblet Squat** | With regular squats, you can cheat a little bit with your depth. However, goblet squats force you to achieve greater depth. I found this translates really well to other leg exercises. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3412254e-1a87-4cbc-82b2-d0f8aca1c0f6)

| **Baysian Curls** | This exercise has a great stretch at the starting position for your biceps (this is good for building muscle!). I only recently started doing these as opposed to regular bicep curls, and I really feel the difference. | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbd398d7-8fd1-4d61-9187-89dc25bece2c)
